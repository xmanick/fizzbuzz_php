A classic example is to create a program that prints numbers 1 through 100. If the printed number is divisible by 3 \"Fizz\" is also displayed, if the number is divisible by 5 \"Buzz\" is also displayed, and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 \"Fizzbuzz\" is also displayed. Otherwise, only the number is printed.\r\n\r\n###What's the point?\r\nFizzbuzz questions have allowed employers to find the best thinkers to hire for the job. A surprising amount of programmers can't complete these questions, because they require one to solve a problem on their own, without the help of an instructor or a book. The ability to go through a logical problem and successfully turn it into code is a skill that employers are looking for.\r\n\r\n###What's the file?\r\nThe file is a basic php version of fizzbuzz code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
